## 📚 Weekly Study Breakdown  

### **📌 Section 8 – High Availability & Scalability**

- Auto Scaling Groups  
- Elastic Load Balancing  
- Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region  
- Resilient architectures  

### **🌐 Section 10 – Route 53**

- Routing policies

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting  

### ❓ My Route 53 concepts feel confusing  

Try mapping each routing policy to a real-life scenario.  
Example:  

- **Failover routing ➜** Medical backup systems  
- **Latency routing ➜** Gaming servers  

### ⚠️ I don’t understand Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region  

Remember:  

- **Multi-AZ = high availability**  
- **Multi-Region = disaster recovery + global performance**
